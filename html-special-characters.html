	<h1>Heidi's Take on HTML Special Characters</1h>

	<p> 
		While on webmonkeys site I came across a nice quote defining special characters. Webmoneky wrote, &ldquo; To make special characters and accented letters show up on your pages, use a special set of codes called character entities, which you insert into your HTML code and which your browser will display as the corresponding symbols or characters you want. &rdquo; To quote webmonkey with proper &ldquo;&rdquo;, opposed to "", I entered the code &ldquo ; &#38; &rdquo ;, (the semicolons should be next to the o but for this example I gave it a space.) Coding is tedious and there is no room for error. The browser will not be able to decipher the code and there will be not computations if you make mistakes.

		So I insert these codes called character entities into my code in sublime text and the browser reads them as symbols and characters. I get this but I am still a little confused about UTF8 vs. IOS 8859. From what I gather UTF8 has space for more characters, but what does that mean? Also, this html file is speaking only to the browser, I turned off my wifi and the page still opened in the browser. That blew my mind.
