	<h1>Heidi's Take on HTML Semantics</1h>

	<p> 
		HTML semantics help organize the content of websites/pages. These semantic elements create structure for your document, structure that helps both the reader/coder, and various processies/ors make sense of the content on your website/page. In other words semantic elements make it possible to create consistent outlines that are easy for search engines, web browsers &amp the visually impaired make sense of. HTML semantics label the page/website, making it clear what section represent what.

		The term semantics literally computes as the study of meaning. The dictionary note that semantics, &ldquo;focuses on the relation between signifiers, like words, phrases, signs, and symbols, and what they stand for, their denotation.&rdquo; I looked this up at the end of my researching process of HTML semantics. It is a nice synthesizes in relation to HTLM semantics.
