		<p>
		Clearfix is not so clear. It seems like there are tons of ways to clear a float. I am not sure which way is best. I figure solutions are context based, different scenarios demand different methods of clearing. You can {clear:both;} which seemed to work for me, but I don't think it is always this simple. 
		<p>
		I have confusion around editing within the HTML, versus CSS. I didn't understand why is it better to edit within the CSS until I watched this video http://www.cssreset.com/understanding-clearing-floats-css-tutorial/. After this clearfix started to make a bit more sense. Clearfix works in every web browser under the sun which make it a better choose. Basically how I understand it is that clearfix allows you to add content that the viewer can't see after the parents element. This content clears the float and works out the flow of the page.
