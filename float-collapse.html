		<p> 	
		What exactly do float properties do to your elements? We see floats in print everyday. Magazine have floating box on one side of the page while content flows down along side the floating box. What is tricky here is when we bring these floating properties into the world of HTML and CSS were there is already set rules for a normal flow. Once floating is applied that element is set as far left or right as the set value allows. This disrupt the normal flow and causes float collapse. Meaning there is not enough room for the parent elements. 
		</p>
		<p>
		This float collapse can be fixed in a number of ways. I am not sure which is best. You can go in and fix it within the HTML with a clear property fix, but I think it is best to make corrections in the CSS.
