	<h1>CSS Properties</h1>
		<p> CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheet. CSS informs and dictates how HTML elements are going to look. Ashton Sanders very clearly notes that, &ldquo;CSS Properties define what aspect of the selector will be changed or styled.&rdquo; There are so many CSS properties it is hard to know what to use when. Also, it is hard to understand fully what the potential is for styling your HTML. Also, the term CSS declarations are comprised of, a property name and a value, example: h2{color:#666}

		<p> While color, font size, font weight etc. are important another interesting, and I image very important aspect of CSS properties is CSS property positioning. This is more complex than, float, top, right, bottom and left. There are another confusing set of values: inherit, static, relative, absolute and fixed.

		<ol>
		  	<li>Inherent: take on the same attribute of its parent.</li>
		  	<li>Static: follows the normal flow.</li>
		  	<li>Relative: is off set from the initial positioning in the flow.</li>
		  	<li>Fixed: is an absolutely positioned box. In print media the element will be on every page.</li>
		  	<li>Absolute: are position boxs removed from the flow. They have no effect on later siblings.</li>
        </ol>
